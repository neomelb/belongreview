Telstra, their parent company, should just be the ISP. There is no benefit in having another middle man. The internet dropouts are every couple of minutes and the call centre people, though they try to help, are hard to understand, write down their numbers incorrectly as they don't understand what I am saying and generally, it is yet another case for doing away with outsourcing call centres to non locals.  It is vital to be able to communicate and here, Belong fails. Their technology is poor - the modems are flimsy and while you can't plug them into a surge guard (as they advise a straight into wall connection) they die fast with the normal electrical surges. (We have had no storms).  This means Netflix can't be watched. Nor Youtube or any of the other online services. So I am as grumpy as heck and really, as they have broken their contract by selling me a pathetic service, I am very quickly looking for an alternative. Oh, the replacement of their non-working modem will be '3-5 working days' and when I asked 'can't I go somewhere and pick it up and swap my old one?' the guy responded with the fact that there is NO SHOP FRONT. The ISP we had when living in a small Mexican town would swap the modem instantly, no questions asked provided you had the box.  Anyway, I'm all for returning to the good old days of the PMG when the guys there could fix everything and your old bakelite phone never let you down.

They took 3 weeks to connect us that time and delayed us for 2 weeks longer because of some street connection story they gave us. That year, however, connection was generally okay. It was pretty slow for $65 p/m, though. Second time was October last year. I honestly dreaded being with Belong again. Because my landlord asked me for internet recommendations, I tried to drift his opinion to literally ANY other provider. He\u2019s a cheapskate and a half, however, and went with Belong\u2019s cheapest offer for a house of 4. I only use an iPhone and an Xbox on a second floor, and both my devices drop out CONSTANTLY. I often leave my phone disconnected from wifi just so my Xbox can actually work without problem. When I use my iPhone, I have to sit on a staircase just for it to work properly. My internet constantly drops out and says either \u201cincorrect password\u201d for no reason, and regardless of if I re-enter the password each time, or, \u201cunable to join\u201d. All I have to do is click \u201ccancel\u201d every single time it pops up, which could be anywhere from 3 times to upwards of 20, and it reconnects anyway. I can\u2019t even send a message or watch more than 15 seconds of a YouTube video on my phone before the wifi disconnects again. Not only my constant problems and SH*T connection, but the telephone service is shocking as well. Lazy, slow, very laidback, never seem to have a good answer, and always want to \u201cget the superviser\u201d. They always give you brain dead suggestions such as \u201chave you turned the modem off and on again?\u201d, uh, have you fixed your service yet? I wouldn\u2019t even pay $20 a month for my service.

So when a few days later I was checking my bank account and discovered that Belong had taken a payment from my account.

Great customer service with knowledgeable people on the other end of the line. I ordered the modem on the Monday 20th Nov 2017 and received it on the Wednesday 22nd Nov morning. Because the previous tenants had Belong too, the 'internet line' was already connected to Belong and I just had to plugin my own new modem and enter the password into the WiFi network detected for it to work. We have had internet with Belongs for almost 3 weeks now and it is working perfectly fine. We took the no-contract unlimited internet with Naked ADSL for 69.99 dollars per month. The reason why we went with Belong was because iinet was offering the same (60 dollars for the modem then 70 dollars per month, but making us pay an additional 80 dollars of 'activation fee' while the activation fee with Belong was free so we saved 80 dollars going with them despite the bad reviews and would recommend to anyone to reconsider them. Who knows, they might have been crap in the past and improved? Our personal experience was definitely good. We felt the need to write a review here to balance all the bad reviews about them considered the good experience we had. Also worth noticing that their app works very well, for example we wanted to change the debit card to make the monthly debit payment and that was very easy. Same for downloading an invoice.\n", "date": ["<meta itemprop=\"datePublished\" content=\"2017-12-11\">"]},

Called them again...this time the representative listened and didn't know what to say or do and I was on hold for a long time, then the line cut off and did not receive a call back..I called them back straight away, another person picked up, had to repeat the story again. The whole thing is just so poor and ridiculous, everyone says something different and the representatives absolutely have no idea what they are talking about! I wanted this last person (ID number 11929) to listen the previous conversation that I had with the lady. He put me on hold, came back and talked about the plans again which was irrelevant to our conversation! I asked him if he listened the conversation that I had with the lady representative, he said yes, and denied my side of the story. But 2mins after, he said \"Even if I listened to the recording...which confirmed that he did not listen and lied to me!! It is just crap and so unprofessional! What is the whole point of calling Customer Service then, if they won't listen, try to fix the issue PLUS lie and tell you what you say is incorrect!! I was very upset and asked him to email me the recording. He said he did email me and it will take 7-10 days. Sadly, I don't believe it will arrive.

Every-time i call up Belong, they come up with a new story. they send modem to wrong address, they somehow send message of activation then again say that it was a mistake as some other connection, after 15days again they ask for proof of dwelling, then some other story.. i am fed up. Trust me BELONG is literally playing with me and i can assure that they are totally unprofessional and just lie to customer always. No person will wait for over a month for a broadband connection, btw i live in sydney's macquarie park , not in some desert.. @ BELONG are you hearing ? i at times feel like i am customer service guy myself as i call or chat with belong support almost every single day since last 10days.. pity that government is allowing such companies to fool the public..

I am so sick of paying money for bad service and no data. I had to by a mobile dongle to get internet just to have something going and they don't care what loss you have suffered(and state this as policy).I cant stand waiting for false hopes so the people have to know, Im sorry do your jobs right so we don't have to give bad feedback.  Before this, because of their modems they had supplied I had 21 phone calls and 4 visits to get my service back online because they guess how to fix the service. Its best to supply your own modem over a distance of about 2.5km as the modem they supply is cheap and nasty and I discovered this after 3 of them in 3 months. The modems cause insertion loss which means the modem itself drops the signal down. I found this out by comparing the Telstra Linesmans modem and putting the modem back in then observing the loss was far greater on the belong modem. Since I replaced the modem the service is much better as I increased from 2.8-3 to 4.8 mb/s the best I can get and the drop outs way less. But in the rain its useless and I can prove this by the noise on the line increasing and dropping off after a few days of sunshine. So Belong figures you wait this out I guess and you wait. This can be fixed by new o-rings and a bit of Vaseline on the pit joiner seals along the line route, but some of the telstra blokes cant be bothered.  If they were smart you would have humidity meters in the joint to see ingress and report back the diags, but this is common sense something not dealt with today.\n", "date": ["<meta itemprop=\"datePublished\" content=\"2017-10-28\">"]},

So then I recieved a $55 charge to my credit card from belong on the 1/8/17, so I rang them and they said it was for the internet service...............aaaaaahhhhhhh that I haven`t recieved!!!! They said that they sent me a sms saying that I was connected on the 11/6/17, then read the sms message to me. I know I got that sms, but it said your connection is in progress, NOT CONNECTED!!!!!.If I knew it was connected, I would have used it for the last 7 weeks!!! I told them this, but they didn`t quite grasp the idea that they are the one`s at fault, and how did they connect me anyway when I needed to provide proof of residence to get connected in the 1st place!!!

I work at an international airport with hundreds of ppl I meet on a daily basis, and I will be telling them all never to go with this company.

I am now with Teltra who I should have gone with in the 1st place, but I was trying to save some money as our family is on a strict budget, but It has ended up costing me alot of wasted time and money. Yes I agreed to pay the dissconnection fee, but my only other choice was to pay out the $55 a month for an internet service that I already had through Telstra, so It would have cost me even more.

I did read the reviews on this site and was a little worried about the service I may be getting from Belong but to my surprise the modem turned up within 3 days of ordering and the connection was up and running 2 days before the promised date. My download speed has increased from Telstra's 3MB/s to Belong's 5MB/s. This is a minor miracle considering the distance from my place to the nearest exchange is around 5km.

Well what a load of $h!t!! I only found out 2 weeks later, and after I had already been charged for the connection, and after numerous phone calls to the Philippines, (yes that's where they are based) that I had a fibre to the premises connection and an NBN Co. technician would have to come and install a box inside my place. So I was told that Belong had organised for this technician to come and install the box, so I waited and waited and waited....... After yet another call to the Philippines, I was told that this appointment had been cancelled and that they had to make another appointment for the technician to come and install the box, in 2 weeks time. By this time my blood was boiling, but I accepted the appointment time and left it at that. Now this is where my brains basically exploded, after 2 weeks went by I called Belong yet again, one day before my appointment for the install, only to be told my appointment had been cancelled again. \"That's it\", I thought, I'm going to contact the NBN Co. and see what is actually going on, because Belong kept on saying the the NBN Co. were the ones who kept on cancelling my appointments. So I gave the NBN co a call and spoke to a lady whom told me they have NEVER received an order from Belong to attend my premises and install the box. I found out from this nice lady that when a provider requests an appointment for a customer that they are given an O.R.D number, it's like a confirmation number. Belong could not give this to me. I even had the NBN Co lady check if they maybe had given the wrong address for the appointment, No they had not even been so stupid as to do that. They just plain old had not even contacted the NBN Co to install the box at my place. AAARRRRGGGGHHHHH!!! So after over a month later and no internet connection at my place, it was at this point I told them I wanted a refund for everything that I had paid for so far. They said they would only give me a refund once I returned the modem to them, which is fair enough , but they wanted me to pay the postage for this too. \"Like Hell\" I thought, needless to say they said they would send out a reply paid post bag. Yeah right, I have a feeling that I have just lost all the money I have forked out. I am so disgusted that people could be so idiotic!

I hope you have an unlimited phone plan and a day or two off work to go on hold and then get disconnected anyway. What do they care, they have your contract. I read that someone got 6 mbps. You're lucky.haha\n", "date": ["<meta itemprop=\"datePublished\" content=\"2017-05-03\">"]},

For the last few weeks my internet connection has been dropping in and out.  I called Belong who suggested I change the DNS Server settings which I have done but it hasn't really made any difference.  Whenever you do call customer service you are on hold for over 30 mins and this has not improved over the years. So I called them again today to enquire about switching over to NBN.  The guy I spoke to told me if I did this I would be without internet connection for 5 -7 business days.  When I asked him why he couldn't answer my question he just kept repeating it was the \"normal process\"  Several times I asked him why - he still could not answer.  I therefore explained to him that if I was going to be without internet connection for a week I would call up another internet provider and organise the NBN through them.  I therefore suggested that he put me through to someone who could answer my question, otherwise he was about to loose a customer.  He chose to put the phone down on me.   This is not the first time someone in customer service at Belong has done this .   About 18 months ago when I moved into a new unit and was experiencing problems, the same thing happened.  I then called back and after been on hold for another 30 minutes spoke to someone who was really helpful but basically convinced me that I needed to change over to NBN asap otherwise I would continue to have problems with ADSL.  She put me through to the connections team for NBN.  I was asked to choose a plan and speed.  I told him before I could choose a plan and speed he needed to provide the information on what plans and speeds they had available.  He was unable to do this.  He basically was offering me a 12 month plan with a speed of 25.  I asked him to explain what the difference was with the NBN speeds.  He couldn't answer this question.  Again I asked to speak to someone else and guess what - HE PUT THE PHONE DOWN!   So after been on the phone for a total of an hour and a half, two members of staff refused to answer my questions (or couldn't), they refused to put me through to someone who could help and twice they put the phone down on me.

So I opted for the maximum speed boost so I actually pay more than I would for Telstra now but I get 15mbps at the best I call all the time always on hold a minimum of 40mins then we change some things on the computer it gets better for a bit then it's bad again I'm over calling them now I don't even bother I just use my phone as I can't be bothered calling them again. My advise don't go with belong. I found out they piggy back 3/4 properties on the same line that's why it's so slow. Yes I get 100mbps but it's decided between other properties that's why it's always slow. I can't be bothered calling them anymore I hope they see this and call me and cancel it for free as I'm currently making my case for the ombudsman.\n", "date": ["<meta itemprop=\"datePublished\" content=\"2017-02-15\">"]},

The Telstra technicians didn't show up by 2:30pm on the selected day so I called them to notify them, they apparently called the Telstra wholesale team who apparently got in contact with the technicians who said they were running late and to wait as they were still on their way to my house and they needed access to my apartment not just the exchange or the communications room in my building. The technicians did not show up at all. I've called back multiple times since that day with Belong customer service technicians or representatives after that particular day as the service was still not working. I have been told again today that they will need to log another fault with Telstra (this is the 4th time I've been told this as the last one was apparently escalated to a tier 2 technician). After spending 10+ hours on the phone troubleshooting and having a day off work the service is now actually worse than the first day I received the text message implying the service was active as I atleast then had a solid green DSL light along with power and wifi, the Internet light remains red to this day and I have no internet.

Work colleagues living within a block radius of me signed up and were connected with Telstra within 1-2 weeks while I waited almost 2 months. Once connected the NBN Co rep couldn't get my modem working as it had shipped with the wrong settings, something he said he sees a lot from Belong. I had to contact Belong and it took almost a week for them to organise a call back from a tech person to run through setting up the modem. 65 days total from first contact to being online, charged for the lot. Since then there has been problems with the wifi, eventually I got a straight answer from a tech who told me to supplied modem is the most barebones, cheapest, nastiest thing they could source so should I want any kind of wifi functionality I would have to purchase my own. Any more than 1 device connected would stop all wifi from working, more than one app on a device would do the same, speed test wouldn't even run, standing a meter from the modem with the only device connected to it might let a few images to load, then ultimately websites still crash. Turning off wifi and using mobile data and everything loads perfect. My kids enjoy online gaming, however even over cable it is not available due to settings in the modem that are unable to be changed. Once again the tech advised me that the issue is due to the cheap, nasty modem supplied and recommended again that if any kind of online gaming was to be viable a new modem would need to be purchased. Obviously at my expense too. Complete refusal by customer service to deal with the issue, absolute rudeness by phone operators and talking online via facebook I get the same copy and pasted responses over and over again.

I signed up with Belong in February after our area was connected to the NBN but only via copper to the node. I firstly had issues with them being able to set up an appointment time, I eventually had to sort it myself via their website and their were technical issues with that too so in the end it took 5 weeks for our connection appointment. The first appointment came on a day I hadn't picked so my husband had to take the day off work. The fellow got there and told us there were issues on our street with a broken cable which would need to be fixed. Over the next five months we had ten more NBN connection appointments where we had been assured that the issue had been fixed. I spent a ridiculous amount of time on the phone to Belong I was pregnant at the time so on two occasions towards the end I actually cried with frustration on the phone. I ended up with a case manager at Belong and with the NBN both of whom still told me things were fixed for the last three appointments. Finally had the actual connection sorted in September and it still took Belong a week to get the text activation code. Once we actually got the service it was pretty good. Couldn't really stream two shows at once though. In December my card that I had originally provided the details of had expired, they only text to notify me of this and I was overseas for a few weeks, when I had got back they had completely disconnected the service, not an email in sight. I then arranged to have in reconnected but after five days of arranging this I logged into their website to see what was happening and it was apparently awaiting me to arrange a new NBN connection appointment. I just couldn't be after that and cancelled the service all together. Now have a $60 modem I paid for that is apparently unlocked but my new service provider can't seem to get it to work with their service...All in all if theirs no issues at all connecting to the service you might have a smooth run, but if there is, run away from this provider as quick as you can!!!

I followed the installation instructions, but then encountered issue number two - the internet light was red, which means no internet. Bruce called on Friday, 16 Dec to test a few things and came to the conclusion that it's a technical issue that requires a technician to come out but the only available appointment was on Friday, 23 Dec, which means another week wasted and taking time off work for something that will probably not be resolved. He made no effort to escalate the issue for quick resolution and offered no compensation for the lack of service.  I had no choice but to cancel the service I never had.

Full download speed 24/7 and the connection was never down - not once.  I then moved house into a NBN area and signed up to Optus on the 100/40Mbit speed plan.  Speed was great when I tested it just after connection!  But that was around 2pm in the afternoon.  As soon as 4-5pm hits, international traffic slows to a crawl right up until 1-2am the following morning.  Anything hosted in Australia was fine 24/7 (or anything that has an Australian mirror like Netflix, Steam, etc).  However you try to do something like update your iPhone software during peak time and it would be an all night affair, providing the connection didn't time out and make you having to start all over again.  Optus was like this EVERY SINGLE NIGHT right up until I decided to disconnect 1year and 3months after signing up - thankfully they let me out of my 2 year contract without penalty.  That's when I saw an ad on TV for Belong, powered by Telstra.  I wanted my Telstra-grade broadband back, but not at Telstra pricing, so I signed up over the phone (and actually saved $10/month compared to my very moderately priced Optus connection).  The connection was ready the very next day and straight away the peak hour speed was perfect.  I have now tested downloading at peak hour for about 3 weeks now, and I am extremely happy to say that there is no peak hour congestion with Belong whatsoever.  I can get full 100mbit download speeds 24/7 from any source in the world (providing they can support that bandwidth at the other end of course).  You even get a real Telstra IP/domain with their service, which is extra reassuring.  To me Telstra has always been the number one ISP in the country as far as speed goes.  The downside is that they are also one of, if not, the most expensive options too (but you get what you pay for).  With Belong you don't have to worry about that at all - very competitive pricing powered by the best network.

You then said you would rebook the technician and send me a text message with a confirmed time and date. I never got that text message. I called back 2 days later, you again told me that you were sorry that the text never went through and that you would lodge another complaint and send a text through with a new time and date, BUT surprise again I never received a text message. I then called back (mind you waiting 40 minutes on hold every time before I speak to someone) and I asked you to create an appointment then and there for a technician because I had lost all hope in the \"you'll get a text from us situation\" You then told me someone would come by my house between business hours (no specific time) on Tuesday the 4th October. Well guess what no one came by my house and I took a day off work (and had to cancel important clients). I then called back today and you told me someone had come to my house at 6pm the previous day and left me a note. Well I was home at 6pm (not that I would consider that business hours) and there was no note. Unless you stood infant of my apartment block and decided not ringing my doorbell was \"showing up\" no one came.

She said it could take a week, and I said it would probably be two weeks, as I live in Darwin and he'd probably want to go fishing, we laughed about it. She said in the mean time she would send me a mobile modem to use until my internet was fixed. On the 14 March a tech guy called from the Gold Coast named [name removed]. We went through a heap of tests, the same tests I did about 7 months before. After about an hour of pulling plugs and resetting things we didn't achieve anything. We made a time 6.30 the next evening to try again. I cancelled social plans to be at home for the call. He didn't! The next day I rang [name removed] again, as she fad given me her direct Melbourne line if I had any dramas. I told her about my missed appointment with [name removed]. [name removed] dang a few hours later while I was at work, to apologise and seeing he was so busy, asked for permission to call me after 8pm. I again cancelled my plans to be home so that we could sort my internet. You guessed it! He didn't call again!! I again called [name removed] the next day, who again apologised. I quoted her about the tech guy she promised and the mobile internet modem. She then said she would express the modem up to me and it would be with me in a couple of days. That was over two weeks ago. No tech guy, no modem and [name removed] no longer takes my calls. As I was leaving a message a day for the first week after. I made another complaint to the TIO as the matter was supposed to be rectified by the 24 March. Guess what? They're still billing my account. Belong are hell, apart from damages to my business and inconvenience I'm thinking about complaining about their slogan. Belong- hassle free internet on your terms!!!

I got a text saying I would be connected by the 15th of February. I called them on 11th Feb and advised them I still didn't get any modem. They said they would send another and made another PROMISE I would get it the next day. Being patient another week went by and still nothing. I called them again, they said they would send another modem (3rd time and made another promise). At this point I was almost at my boiling point. I kept my cool but then I checked my bank account 4 days later and I saw they had taken $40.00 off my visa card without any text or notification which really hit a nerve. I called them the next day and told them how angry I was and that the next time I would call I will disconnect. The agent told me that they had already confirmed and delivered the modem at 23 (my neighbour) and not 23b which is me. He also said he wasn't sure why we got charged. He told me that the courier people kept coming to my property and did not leave any note to pick up the item at the post office or to just leave it at my property. He told me also if I want to cancel the contract, it would be a $300 cancellation fee. Oh my god this is the worst company I have ever come across in my whole 26 years of my life. Luckily I am a very patient guy, I told them to just leave the modem at my address and to refund my $40.00 but told them that I would cancel with them in my next call and told them if they charge me the $300 I will be seeking the ombudsman. Finally after 3 days after that call I got my modem. The telstra contractor technician said they would come in a few days later and connect me and my connection date was 15 March.

(an absolute joke) and I am going out of my mind as they keep telling us that its a telstra problem and that they will send a technician and it should get fixed. I feel as if I am bashing my head against a brick wall. Tomorrow the ombudsman will be getting a call from me. I am sick to death of the way these shoddy companies treat their customers.
